Note: Due to a work deadline yesterday, this piece is a retrospective from December 10. I apologize for any deterioration in the recollection.

I was scheduled to go to the top college of my country to pick up robotic kits today! My team qualified for stage two of a robotics competition, and to prepare for the coming challenges we had to pick up our hardware kits from the college itself.

We were originally scheduled to go at 8th, but one of my friends (let’s call them Lee) was bitching about it. He insisted that we go on the 9th of December. I wanted to go with a crowd, and most of the people were going on the 8th, but after pulling some strings I got everyone to join me on 10th! I was most looking forward to going with Joy, since we’ve been coordinating a lot for the coming event.

The event was already off to a bitter start, but I didn’t let that get in my way. Lee decided to not join us directly, because joining us halfway made more sense to him somehow. I went out of my way to make arrangements so that he comes with us, but he still goes out of his way to do whatever he wants. I stopped caring about him that instant and decided to not let him affect my day.

On the day of the event, things went quite smooth. I met Joy, Vance, Leonard, and the rest of my friends at college and took off with them! It was fun chatting, taking the trains, and cracking jokes as we travelled to the other college.

When we reached the top college, it was so serene. The atmosphere was very calming, the whole vibe was very laid back. We all walked around the huge campus to explore the buildings it had to offer! The campus of this college completely blew off our college’s campus. It was super fun.

We caught up with an old professor who used to teach us but had transferred to this college. After that, we went to pick up our robotic kits.

While picking up, I had the chance to talk to the organizers of the competition. They were really cool and asked our suggestions on the topic we could do an internship on if we were to win the competition. We asked them about future guidance relating to FPGA programming and computer architecture. We also showed them our in-house robots and their components, they liked it and motivated us to come join them for making more cool things!

Things took a bit of a hiccup at lunch, Lee got in the way. But I didn’t let that disturb the rest of the group and let him do whatever he wanted. We went for some pizza (inside campus!), and we also got some juice and coffee (watermelon juice for me).

After that, we walked our way back to the entry gate, took some photos outside, and went back to our college. A very fun trip!

I enjoyed a lot with Joy at the trip. She and I exchanged some glances and some great jokes. She’s really fun and helpful. It would be nice to have someone like her on my side. I won’t ask her out though, since she doesn’t seem the kind of person who dates, nor do I want to change anything in our friendship. Good friends are rare these days.

I also got to see more of some friends I’ve been meaning to hang out with more. I really wish I could go out again with them sometime!

The rest of the day was really generic. I worked on the exhibition event, which was to be on 10th(tomorrow), while also working on a seven-segment display shield for my CPU. Fairly good day.
