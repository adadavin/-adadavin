# The month of may 2023

Last month I gave an update on how I shall be starting toughlove for accountability, and reguarly study and sizably work on my projects? Well hello there everyone, I've failed colossally. 

Let's start with toughlove. The application got accepted right away and I started with my week smoothly. It was hard since getting up early for Yoga is challenging. As a week passed, I got wrapped up in some activities and I simply forgot the Toughlove tasks of a particular week, earing me a strike. After that I pretty much gave up.

I kept up the habitica for all of the coming weeks, but gave up using it before my end semester exams. I wasn't able to make much progress in my internship implementation until the last week of the deadline.

I am in midst of my end semsters, and they have been pretty shitty. I am studying for a degree in EE as everyone knows, but I suck at all the subjects. All the subjects have bad teachers and require a sustained effort throughout the semester for a good grade. The plan for studying regularly didn't execute and I ended up not studying anything uptil the last week of exams.

I have an eerie feeling that my health problems shall return after a few days. Big L moment.

## What has been going good?

I got the position of an executive secretary at my local organization, so that was really cool. I get to make high level management decisions for spreading the knowledge of robotics! 
I now have good sense of where my research will be heading, so I feel I can wrap it up within time frame - provided I buckle down and work.
In the coming summer, not only will I have written a research paper, but I shall also have learn how to drive, and worked on my personal project of creating a sillicon tapeout! Finally a two month holiday :D

## Concluding

I don't know how the rest of the end semesters will go, but I'll try to give them decently. I'll put a visitor counter in this website so I have a sense of the amount of people viewing my 1AM notes. I appreciate all viewers, gives me a feeling that there are poeple watching out.

I'll write a better follow up in some time, this was just a freestyled version.

Thanks for reading
