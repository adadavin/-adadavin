Hi again everyone!

My recent post generated a fair amount of traffic yesterday. Good to know people actually pay a visit to these pages.

I’ll just be talking about my day today. I want to finish studying a fair amount of my Math midterm syllabus about fifty percent. My math this semester mostly focuses on Probability and I’ve got a wide range of topics! I have baye’s theorem, random variables, discrete and continous probability density functions, expectation, probability distribution functions, a lot more stuff!

Today I mostly covered the basics, studied baye’s theorem, random variables - both discrete and continuous, probability distribution of a discrete random variable, probability distribution function for a discrete random variable, probability density function of a continuous random variable, continuous distribution function for a discrete random variable. That concludes about 25% of my syllabus! 

I still have to work on some research paper work today, mostly try and get the benchmark numbers by this weekend since I’ll be a lot more busy next week and might not be able to run code.

For the rest of the day, I wasted a lot of time watching Riverdale. I think I might review the show over here. An in depth review. Lately, I started watching again from Season 6. I had stopped at season 6 since they were still rolling out episodes and I didn’t see a new episode for some weeks and I forgot about the series. Riverdale is a fascinating show and deserves a good review, to unravel it’s complexity. I think I’ll work on it sometime after Mid Semester!

I hope to finish all math studies tomorrow, but for now, sleep awaits! Toodles :3
