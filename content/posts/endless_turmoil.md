Amidst the toil and endless strife, I wander through this mortal life. Each step I take, each breath I draw, Only leaves me with a sense of flaw.

I work and work to make things right, But still I’m trapped in endless night. My bones they ache, my spirit’s weak, And in my heart, despair doth speak.

For all my efforts, all my toil, I find no rest from constant moil. And though I wish to end this pain, I fear that I am wrong again.

The weight of life, it pulls me down, And in my heart, a heavy frown. For though I long to end this pain, The thought of how, it makes me strain.

To end this turmoil for all, I would try, to cease the strife, to still the cry. But to do so, so many would die, for this turmoil is life’s cruel, truest guise.

And so I’m left with this refrain, A longing heart, a spirit pained. For though I wish to end it all, The cost of such would be my fall.

So I will walk this endless road, And bear the weight of life’s harsh load. For though it pains me, I’ll stay strong, And keep on singing life’s sad song.
