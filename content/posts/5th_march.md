Hello everyone!

After completing my migration of the blog, as talked about in the previous post, I come back here!

I am quite bad at life, always behind deadlines and I am not able to compete with the people of my wavelength. But there are two special people that keep me moving.

The first one is my cat. She's powers me through the day with her cute fur, and my mood delights with her sight.

The second one would be my best friend. She's a long distance best friend, but we're very close. We talk about the issues we've faced, the things that have excited us this week, often about philosophical things and controversial things.
She's a very wise person and her opinions always make sense. In some ways I draw inspiration from her, and use her advice as anchor at times. She's much more mature than I am so often her advice is spot on!

Sometimes I feel neglected by her too, but that just might be my problem. If I don't have anyone to talk to, I run here and make a post! It's good to put stuff here.

Tomorrow my day will be going into paper reading, literature survey and math problems. I hope to be productive tomorrow. Hopefully one day I'll get the hang of life.

Until next time,

Ada.
