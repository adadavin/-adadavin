Hi everyone. 

I was watching Riverdale after a long time, and I realized that I never made an update to my blog. I find Jughead to be really cool, and his relationship with Tabitha has been great. I am really happy to see them close. My idea to maintain blogs actually came when I would see Jughead narrating the story of Riverdale everyday. 

I've been doing somewhat worse since my last update. I got kicked out of the Toughlove group for not making updates regularly, I flunked my upcoming end semester test. I half-assed my summer internship, and I am talking to you all in October....where I have my mid-semester exams from next week as well as a conference paper due next week. And of course, I am ill prepared for both.

Why talk about my sick present. Let's talk about something exciting. Let's try to find some friend today online!

So, I log onto reddit, hop onto the r/MakeNewFriendsHere subreddit and scroll through the new posts to find some person to chat with. The last time I was here, I found someone who was wayy older than me and they didn't speak English fluently. Surprisingly, I find them posting on the subreddit today finding someone to speak with! Interesting.

Nevertheless, this is all just a distraction from my paper writing or studying for the upcoming mid semester test but.... procrastination will always get the better of me...

The first person I meet on the platform likes to play games and watch Anime, so decided to hit them up. They're a really slow talked. I add this stuff to the blog, lost it all due to a broken ssh pipe error, and rewrote it while they only texted two or three messages. Not very engaging.

My bones are not starting to hurt since it's really late right now. I need sleep. But as always, I will self sabotage till the last moment. 

Find another interesting person online. They posted their website for me. They seem fun! Never mind, even they have gone silent now. I wanted to introduce them to tilde.club, but alas.

I am tired and I think I'll call it a night now. I'll try to keep writing to you guys since it's really unfair to be silent for so long. 

For now, Toodles :D
