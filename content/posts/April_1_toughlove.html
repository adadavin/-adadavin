<p>title: &ldquo;Some toughlove for structure&rdquo;

<h2>draft: true</h2>

<p>Hello! I&rsquo;ve been on bedrest since 18th of march, because I developed some infection in my lower back muscle. I experienced an unbelievable amount of pain in the first few days, being able to rest my back only in one position, that is laying down. I was unable to use any devices, therefore all my plans for after the mid-semester were spoiled.</p>

<p>The treatment involved a lot of rest and a lot of medicines, which were some muscle relaxers and some antibiotics. On 26'th of March I felt great, but the pain was still present. The doctor recommended another week of bed rest since not being in immediate pain was only an indicator that the antibiotics were holding the infection off - it wasn&rsquo;t gone yet. Now, as I type on 1'st of April, I feel alright. I have a lot of weakness from the infection, as a result my neck hurts a lot. The pain is still present but I feel that it&rsquo;s just the muscles still but-hurt.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>This experience has showed me that maybe I&rsquo;ve been taking things with a lot of stress. I should ideally enjoy my university days and not have completely hellish years. A lot of my everyday is just irritating, but I feel that it can be tolerated with some structure to my days - or weeks.</p>

<p>The last time I had maintained a great weekly structure was with the help of this system called Toughlove. In here, we define weekly goals, we define how we&rsquo;ll be completing said goals and we define how we&rsquo;re gonna prove we&rsquo;ve completed the said goals.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an online accountability program, in which everyone performs the steps above and every end of the week we compare our work and proofs. If anyone hasn&rsquo;t done their part of the work they earn a strike. Three strikes and the person is kicked out from the group! Last time I was a part of the group, I had a great streak and I had also earned a lot of respect in the community for doing a lot of hard work.</p>

<h3>Let&rsquo;s fill the form!</h3>
