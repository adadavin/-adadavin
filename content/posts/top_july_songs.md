The top songs of July for me were:

1. Dead! By MCR. Absolutely loved this one!
2. Please Please Please! By Sabrina Carpenter. I discovered her late in July, this title represents my love life T_T.
3. BIRDS OF A FEATHER by Billie Eilish. Very sweet song.
4. A Tear in Space (Airlock) by Glass Animals. A must listen if you haven't.
5. Bulletproof Heart by MCR. I love MCR, I wish I was a teen in 2010s.
