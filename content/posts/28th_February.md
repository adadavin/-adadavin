When one has no one to talk to, one can become crazy. My days have been reduced to tiring filth. I can no longer feel true and lasting joy. Each time I feel like things are going well, a sudden rush of “Terms and Conditions” fills me, reminding me that all of the joy is fake and I’ll never experience genuine happiness.

My body has become so heavy that even the most menial tasks require a great deal of effort. I was told that once someone starts exercising their willpower, it becomes easier to do tasks, but it hasn’t become any easier for me.

I feel like I can’t change things for the better. I don’t have any support, talent, or skills, and I’m destined to fail. It seems like nothing can stop this outcome.

So what can I do? Wade in shark-infested waters? Hopefully, I won’t resort to taking drastic measures such as a toaster bath.
