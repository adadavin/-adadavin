I don’t think anyone really cares about me. I feel like such a failure, like I’ve completely screwed up my life. I thought being dependable and always helping others would earn me some kindness in return, but instead, I’m just someone people hit up when they need something. I’m left feeling so alone and isolated.

Today, I was in excruciating pain and spent the whole day weeping, yet no one bothered to check on me. It’s so unfair that I go out of my way for others, but they can’t do the same for me. It’s no wonder I find it so hard to ask for help.

I’m done putting others first. From now on, I’m going to focus on myself and only give attention to those who deserve it. Only those who are willing to go out of their way for me will receive any attention or effort from me. It’s time for me to start prioritizing my own needs, even if it means cutting some people out of my life. It’s just so frustrating and heartbreaking that it has to come to this.
