Hello again everyone! Do you like the new look of the site?

This new look is the result of a slight mishap that happened when I tried to move my blog files to my tilde home folder, from my local computer. The transfer was taking ages using sshfs, and my impatient self pulled the plug on the transfer.

What I didn't notice was, instead of copying the files I was _moving_ them to the server. Since the transfer was incomplete, I deleted the partially transferred files from my tilde home folder and with that, went all of my posts and my configs for the site.

After that, I took out some time from my busy schedule and created another blog transferring all of my posts from my old site to here. Hugo is an excellent platform for blogging, and I really like this new theme. I've even found a bug which I hope to patch!

I know I haven't posted a big update, but now is not the time. It's almost 1AM and all my feelings are tending towards the negative. Maybe I'll freshen up a bit and write it all out in a new post right now? Stay tuned.

Until next time, 

Ada.
