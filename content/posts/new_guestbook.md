Hi Everyone!

I've added a new guestbook to the site! hope to get in touch with all of you through the guestbook. 

You will also notice that the site has been reduced to trash due to an update in my hugo theme. I hate it and will change that after my mid semester test. I aim to write the site fully in custom html and css. Enough of this crap.

Please don't abuse the guestlist I forgot to add capcha. 

Until next time, toodles!
