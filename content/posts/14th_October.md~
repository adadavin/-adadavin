Hi.

Today I feel free. I can work on anything now! Wanna do something fun :D 

Me and my friend have decided to try and make a game. We want to tell a fun story to the world, something cool. We’re really bad with art, so were hoping someone else can help us out.

I’m in a dilemma myself. I don’t know if I like programming or tech anymore. I haven’t enjoyed or programmed passionately for some time now. Maybe it’s because I’ve just got out of a burnout and need some time to do something else.

My usual routine just involves me sitting in front of my computer and working on something. For the past two years, I’m mostly working on some project in my club. We started off with esp32 programming, and then I was assigned a project to develop a RISC-V CPU using HDL. After that, I interned under a professor of a US university, and co-authored a paper with them.

My internship experience wasn’t that great. The professor wanted me to write a paper and they simply wanted to mentor me. They did not want to write the paper in any way, they simply wanted to mentor. Which would be fine if the topic wasn’t so vast! The research process was very new to me, even the tools for research were new, so it was a big learning curve.

Now, I am wondering what I’ll be doing next. Maybe back to firmware programming, or continue with HDL work? I have no idea.

I do have some expectations though. If I intern somewhere, I expect to be paid because I feel if anything is unpaid then it isn’t serious. Next, if I work on a project with some people, I expect them to be motivated, or else the project simply dies out with no traction.

I can also not engage in anything extra curricular and simply focus on my curriculum. My college curriculum is very boring, because my college simply lacks the teachers and infrastructure for teaching properly.

Let's see what I can come up with. Maybe once I am done with the site redesign, I can finalize what I'll be doing. Until next time, toodles :3
