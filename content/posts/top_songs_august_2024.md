I listened to 2,669 minutes of songs this month!

My top songs were:

1. Summertime - MCR
2. Famous Last Words - MCR
3. Tailwhip - Men I Trust
4. Red Wine Supernova - Chappell Roan
5. Femininomenon - Chappell Roan

Again, top artist MCR.

I think my stats will be changing this September. I've listened to almost all MCR songs on repeat and they've got a theme of being heavy on the ears after a while. Charlie XCX made a surprise introduction to my queue as well. Looking forward to next month's update!
