Hello! I've been on bedrest since 18th of march, because I developed some infection in my lower back muscle. I experienced an unbelievable amount of pain in the first few days, being able to rest my back only in one position, that is laying down. I was unable to use any devices, therefore all my plans for after the mid-semester were spoiled. 

The treatment involved a lot of rest and a lot of medicines, which were some muscle relaxers and some antibiotics. On 26'th of March I felt great, but the pain was still present. The doctor recommended another week of bed rest since not being in immediate pain was only an indicator that the antibiotics were holding the infection off - it wasn't gone yet. Now, as I type on 1'st of April, I feel alright. I have a lot of weakness from the infection, as a result my neck hurts a lot. The pain is still present but I feel that it's just the muscles still but-hurt. 

## Structure

This experience has showed me that maybe I've been taking things with a lot of stress. I should ideally enjoy my university days and not have completely hellish years. A lot of my everyday is just irritating, but I feel that it can be tolerated with some structure to my days - or weeks.

The last time I had maintained a great weekly structure was with the help of this system called Toughlove. In here, we define weekly goals, we define how we'll be completing said goals and we define how we're gonna prove we've completed the said goals.

It's an online accountability program, in which everyone performs the steps above and every end of the week we compare our work and proofs. If anyone hasn't done their part of the work they earn a strike. Three strikes and the person is kicked out from the group! Last time I was a part of the group, I had a great streak and I had also earned a lot of respect in the community for doing a lot of hard work.

### Let's fill the form!

1. Yes,	I am re-applying to the	group. The first time I	applied, I left	the group after	a while	because	I had reached the goals	I wanted to achieve, and fulfilled my purpose for joining tough love in the	first place. I was not able to underline my immediate goals at the time, so I decided to leave the group. Now, I believe I have	found a	goal which requires	the weekly accountability and planning as done in tough love.

2. The overarching goal this time will be structure in life and self-care. I am very aligned and motivated to complete my goals, but due to lack of structure I end up either being drained of energy or end up messing up my priority list, therefore never getting to the task in the first place. I'll try to maintain a decent structure, spreading my tasks throughout the week, prioritizing over important tasks and preemptive planning.

3. These goals will be aimed at making my life easier in times of tons of work. Previously in hard situations, I end up overworked and miserable instead of properly approaching the tasks and calmly working on them. The added structure and self-care will help me prevent that and help me properly approach my tasks. At the end of the day, I want to learn about computer systems and make a decent living for myself, and I believe I am quite inclined to this goal.

4. Lately constructive criticism has been a bit hard to absorb. This has been due to my poor mental state(of being constantly overworked) and unclear thinking. I will be trying my best to evaluate input from everyone about my structure, because if I am not gonna take input then there's high chance I'll end up messing up the structure, and get back into the cycle of toppling tasks again.

5. I've seen the recent posts and the people here are extremely focused at their goals! I hope to join them in their run and benefit from the accountability that is present here. 

6. The strikes system is surely gonna keep me on my toes. Will have to set up a reminder for 11:59PM UTC (after converting it to my timezone lol). I look forward to meeting my potential buddies, and have a look at their goals.

That's it for the application!

### Concluding

If anyone, anyone is viewing this site I beg you to send me a mail, even if it is using a random email ID. I just want to know if someone is reading these. I just want to satisfy my inner curiosity.

I'm gonna go now and set up my habitica for working with this system and submit my goals for the week. Will keep you all updated over here! Till next time, everyone please take good care of yourselves!

Bless up,

Ada
